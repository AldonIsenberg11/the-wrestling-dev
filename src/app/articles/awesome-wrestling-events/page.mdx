This is my first SAAS product that i've launched, now I need to get a few customers lined up

## Who it's for

Software simple enough for a soccer mom who knows nothing about wrestling can run their own event.

You can create an event and open it up for registration. You then conduct weigh-ins, create brackets, and manage matches.

## How it works

Select When, Where, & How much and publish the event for registration. Then follow the steps to manage the event.

Wrestling events shouldn't be complicated to manage and you shouldn't need a third party to do it for you.
